System management scripts
-------------------------

Scripts for system management:

* fancontrol: set fan speed based on system temperatures
* diskcontrol: suspend disks based on activity

These scripts are very specific to my system, and are not intended to be reusable as a
whole. Developed for Julia 0.6, with IPMI queries for SuperMicro X9/X10/X11 hardware.
