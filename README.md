Disk+fan management daemon
--------------------------

Daemon for controlling disk power state and fan duty cycle based on activity and
temperatures. This script is very specific, and not intended to be reusable as a whole.

Developed for Julia 0.5, with IPMI queries for SuperMicro X9/X10/X11 hardware.
